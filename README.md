# Hybrid Quantum–Classical QAOA Evaluation Framework with Multi‑Optimizer GUI

## 📌 Overview
This repository presents a **comprehensive evaluation framework** for the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**, implemented entirely in **Qiskit** for the quantum path and integrated with a wide range of classical optimizers. The framework supports **GPU‑accelerated simulation**, **multi‑optimizer benchmarking**, and **interactive GUIs (Tkinter, Jupyter widgets)** for comparative analysis.

The project was developed as part of my research contributions under **Kirankumar Sir**, extending beyond the scope of **qHiPSTER** (Quantum High Performance Software Testing Environment). While qHiPSTER focused on scalable quantum simulation, this framework advances the field by introducing **hybrid quantum–classical orchestration, optimizer benchmarking, and reproducible visualization pipelines**.

## 🎯 Motivation
Variational quantum algorithms like QAOA rely on a hybrid loop: a quantum circuit prepares states, while a classical optimizer tunes parameters. The performance of QAOA depends critically on the choice of optimizer, circuit depth, and computational resources.  
This project addresses these challenges by:
- Benchmarking multiple optimizers (gradient‑based vs gradient‑free).
- Providing reproducible sweeps over depth and repetition cost.
- Integrating GPU acceleration for realistic performance.
- Offering interactive GUIs for exploration and reporting.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Quantum path (Qiskit‑only):**
  - QAOA circuit construction for MAX‑CUT on regular graphs.
  - AerSimulator with GPU acceleration (`device="GPU"`) and fallback to CPU.
  - Exact expectation via Statevector or sampling via measurements.

- **Classical optimization path:**
  - 12 optimizers integrated:
    - *Gradient‑based*: BFGS, L‑BFGS‑B, CG, Newton‑CG, SLSQP, Trust‑Constr.
    - *Gradient‑free*: Nelder‑Mead, Powell, COBYLA, Differential Evolution, Basin‑Hopping, SHGO.
  - Multi‑start runs to avoid poor local minima.
  - Unified interface for optimizer benchmarking.

- **Evaluation sweeps:**
  - Satisfaction vs **QAOA depth** \(p\).
  - Satisfaction vs **repetition cost** (proxy for runtime budget).
  - Smoothed monotonic curves for publication‑ready plots.

- **Interactive GUIs:**
  - **Jupyter widgets**: toggle optimizers, sliders for depth/runs, live plots.
  - **Tkinter desktop GUI**: checkboxes for optimizers, sliders, dropdowns, and comparison plots.
