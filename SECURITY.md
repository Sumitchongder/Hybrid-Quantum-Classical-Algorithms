# Security Policy

## 🔐 Responsible Disclosure

This project involves **quantum algorithms, optimization methods, and GPU-accelerated simulation**.

If you discover a vulnerability, correctness issue, or unsafe assumption, please do **not** open a public issue immediately.

Instead, report it responsibly to the project maintainer via private communication.

Please include:

- Description of the issue
- Affected components (quantum, classical, GUI, GPU)
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact on correctness or performance
- Suggested mitigation (optional)

---

## 🛡 Scope of Security Concerns

Security-relevant issues may include:

- Incorrect objective evaluation or optimizer misuse
- Unsafe GPU memory usage assumptions
- Reproducibility failures due to randomness
- Incorrect claims about performance or optimality
- GUI pathways that crash or corrupt results

---

## 📦 Supported Versions

Only the **latest version** of the repository is actively maintained.
Users are encouraged to keep dependencies (Qiskit, SciPy, CUDA drivers) up to date.

---

## ⚠️ Research Disclaimer

This framework is intended for **research, benchmarking, and educational purposes only**.

It is **not a production-grade quantum optimization service**, and results should not be interpreted as guarantees of quantum advantage.

## 🧾 Acknowledgement

We appreciate responsible disclosure and collaboration to maintain correctness, rigor, and trust in this research.

Thank you for helping keep this project reliable and secure 🔒
